        <h3>About the book</h3>
        <p>
          A marvelous hybrid of mythology and mystery,
          <em> A Wild Sheep Chase </em>
          is the extraordinary literary thriller that launched Haruki
          Murakami&lsquo;s international reputation.
          <br />
          It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive
          receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image
          for an insurance company&lsquo;s advertisement. What he doesn&lsquo;t
          realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with
          a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly
          captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing
          ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a
          surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts
          of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he
          confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of
          tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly
          captivating, A Wild Sheep Chase is Murakami at his astounding best.
